How is pain relieved?\n\n* Elements, such as links, buttons, and other html objects are defined in one \n  location. This ensures over time the user won't have definitions spread out \n  throughout different layers of code requiring time consuming updates if the \n  application under test is modified.\n* Well defined flows allows the user to have a common means for navigating and \n  controlling interactions with the application under test. This takes all logic \n  out of test classes and yields in higher more modular code re-use.\n* When an application requiring testing has the elements and flows implemented \n  less code savy resources can easily add new test cases once trained on how to \n  access the flows and elements.\n* When ever a link or button is clicked a screen shot is taken\n* Results are available under site/results directory in html format. Report \n  includes the rdoc on a per test class method along with any screen shots taken.  \n  Example report: https://cyberconnect.biz/opensource/demo_results.html\n* Transparent remote Unix command execution leading to well defined interfaces \n  for common task. For example, one may have a class defined specifically for \n  RemoteUnixNetwork. This class would have methods such as, assign_ip, ifup, ifdown,\n  etc. This class then would be able to perform these task on any remote Unix machine.\n* Executes the same on Windows or Linux/Unix environments. Developers have the \n  freedom to develop on the platform of choice.\n* Mechanize extension: Allows the user to define a web application's page elements in \n  a YAML format and provide navigation paths accessing the YAML structure to interact \n  with the web application. Users can also perform direct http.post or any other \n  mechanize functionality when defining state-full interfaces to hit a web application \n  without going through a browser."

    "description": "==== QDox - http://qdox.codehaus.org\nQDox is a high speed, small footprint parser for extracting class/interface/method definitions from Java source files complete with JavaDoc @tags. It is designed to be used by active code generators or documentation tools.\n\nQDox is a Java library. Therefore this RubyGem needs JRuby.\n\n==== Quickstart\nStep 1: Load your Java sources. In JRuby (or +jirb+)  write:\n require 'qdox'\n builder = QDox::JavaDocBuilder.new\n builder.add_source_tree(java.io.File.new(\".\")\n\n(Source: http://qdox.codehaus.org/usage.html)\n\nStep 2: Inspect the source model.\n  src = builder.sources.first\n  pkg = src.package\n  puts pkg.name # e.g. \"com.bla.foo\"\n  imports = src.imports # => e.g. [\"java.util.List\", \"java.util.Set\"]\n  some_class = src.classes.first # => a QDox::Model::JavaClass\n\n  # output the javadoc comment for the first method in some_class\n  puts some_class.methods.first.comment \n\n(Source: http://qdox.codehaus.org/model.html)\n\nAs you may have noticed, the Java packages used have been aliased to shorter Ruby Module names:\nThe Java package com.thoughtworks.qdox is the Ruby module QDox etc.\n\n==== In a Nutshell\nA custom built parser has been built using JFlex and BYacc/J. These have been chosen because of their proven performance and they require no external libraries at runtime.\n\nThe parser skims the source files only looking for things of interest such as class/interface definitions, import statements, JavaDoc and member declarations. The parser ignores things such as actual method implementations to avoid overhead (while in method blocks, curly brace counting suffices).\n\nThe end result of the parser is a very simple document model containing enough information to be useful.\n\n==== License\nApache License, Version 2.0\nQDox was created by Joe Walnes, Aslak Hellesoy, Paul Hammant, Mike Williams, Mauro Talevi, Robert Scholte, and others.\nThe RubyGem was created by Benjamin Bock.\n"
