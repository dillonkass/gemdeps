    "description": "= tagomatic\n\nSimple command-line mp3 tagger based on mp3info gem. Supports folder-specific configuration files.\n\nAnother mp3 tagger the world does not need.\n\nBut I needed it. I have a large collection of old mp3 files. From times when tagging was mostly\nbased on the file and folder names. When v2 tags where nowhere close..\n\n== Overview\n\nModes of operation:\n\n* The tagger will try to guess the tags from the full file path by applying a set of known formats.\n* The tagger will apply specific tags given on the command-line.\n* The tagger will match specific formats given on the command-line.\n* Arbitrary combination of the before-mentioned modes.\n\nThe scanner supports recursive folder handling. Of course.\n\nRight now v2 tags are the focus.\n\nIt is probably best to call this alpha ware.\n\n== Usage\n\nFor my genre/artist/album/track.mp3 collection I use this invocation pattern:\n\ntagomatic --underscores --guess --recurse --showtags --errorstops --cleantags /media/music/\n\nThen I add folder-specific .tagomatic or .format= files whenever an error occurs.\n\n== The .tagomatic file\n\nYou can put the (long version) of the command line options into folder-specific .tagomatic files.\nThese options are then valid only for this folder and sub-folders.\n\nThis is useful - for example - if you want to switch guessing off for sub-folders.\n\n== The .format= files\n\nYou can add files named .format= to sub-folders. They will be picked up by tagomatic and added as\ncustom formats just as if you would have passed them on the command line using the --format option.\n\nBecause the slash is not allowed in file names you have to replace it with a vertical dash like in\nthis example:\n\n.format=%g|%a|%b|%n - %t.mp3\n\nThese formats are valid only for this folder and sub-folders.\n\n== Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2009 Daniel Lukic.

This includes socket timeouts and retries.\n- Robust HTTP-level retry layer.  Certain (user-adjustable) HTTP errors returned\n  by Amazon's services are classified as temporary errors.\n  These errors are automaticallly retried using exponentially increasing intervals.\n  The number of retries is user-configurable.\n- Fast REXML-based parsing of responses (as fast as a pure Ruby solution allows).\n- Uses libxml (if available) for faster response parsing.\n- Support for large S3 list operations.  Buckets and key subfolders containing\n  many (> 1000) keys are listed in entirety.  Operations based on list (like\n  bucket clear) work on arbitrary numbers of keys.\n- Support for streaming GETs from S3, and streaming PUTs to S3 if the data source is a file.\n- Support for single-threaded usage, multithreaded usage, as well as usage with multiple\n  AWS accounts.\n- Support for both first- and second-generation SQS (API versions 2007-05-01\n  and 2008-01-01).  These versions of SQS are not compatible.\n- Support for signature versions 0 and 1 on SQS, SDB, and EC2.\n- Interoperability with any cloud running Eucalyptus (http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu)\n- Test suite (requires AWS account to do \"live\" testing).\n"

    "description": "\n## Description\n\nTar horror stories. Everyone has one. You used the wrong flags and accidentally\noverwrote one of your source files without a backup. Or you extracted a tarball\nover your current directory and deleted half the updates to your project. You\nspent 30 minutes scouring Google for the right set of flags to extract a zipped\ntarball instead of an unzipped one. Why are there so many flags!?!\n\nEnter Tartlet. Tartlet is a small commandline wrapper around tar that handles\nthe obnoxious flags for you. Need to extract an archive?\n\n    tartlet extract thinmints.tar.gz\n\nMmmmmmm. Delicious extracted cookies. Need to compress a set of files?\n\n    tartlet compress butter sugar flour --output cookie\n\nMmmmmmmmm. Chocolaty compressed cookies. Tartlet makes it easy to make archives\n(and apparently I'm craving cookies- please hold).\n\n## Installation\n\n\nInstall via gem as:\n\n    $ gem install tart\n\n## Usage\n\nTartlet takes a command and then a list of files, with optional flags thrown\nanywhere.\n\n### Commands\n\n* `compress` - takes a list of files, and by default compresses them into\ngzipped tarball `archive.tar.gz`\n\n    ex:\n\n        $ tartlet compress foo bar baz\n\n* `extract` - takes a single zipped tarball and extracts it into the current\ndirectory\n\n    ex:\n\n        $ tartlet extract archive.tar.gz\n\n### Options\n\nOptions can be placed anywhere in the command, eg. `tartlet -d compress -o\ntarget file1 file2` is the same as `tartlet compress file1 file2 -d -o target`\nwhich is the same as `tartlet compress -d file1 -o target file2`. I prefer to\nput -d before the command, -t after the command but before the files, and -o at\nthe very end, but put them in whatever order makes sense to you.\n\n* `-o VALUE`, `--output VALUE` - instead of using the default output\n(archive.tar.gz or the current directory), direct output to **VALUE**. For\ncompression archive name, tartlet will automatically append the proper file\nsuffix (.tar or .tar.gz) if it is not already provided.\n\n    ex:\n\n        # extract contents of archive into folder 'dirname'\n        $ tartlet extract archive.tar.gz -o dirname\n\n        # compress list of files into tarball 'files.tar.gz'\n        $ tartlet compress foo bar baz -o files.tar.gz\n        -- or --\n        $ tartlet compress foo bar baz -o files\n\n* `--tarball`, `-tar`, or `-t` - treat tarball as not-gzipped, e.g.\n`archive.tar` (vs the default assumption of a gzipped tarball, eg\n`archive.tar.gz`)\n\n    ex:\n\n        # extract contents of archive into current directory\n        $ tartlet extract --tarball archive.tar\n\n        # compress files into non-zipped tarball\n        $ tartlet compress --tarball foo bar baz\n\n* `--dry-run`, `--dry`, `-d` - don't execute any commands, simply print to\nstdout the tar command that would be produced by tartlet\n\n    ex:\n\n        $ tartlet --dry compress foo bar baz --tarball -o files\n        tar -cf files.tar foo bar baz\n\n        $ tartlet extract --dry-run lotsoffiles.tar.gz -o safefolder\n        tar -xzf lotsoffiles.tar.gz -C safefolder\n  "

This release provides\nboth Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.2 support (but please read below). In short, Ruby\n1.8 support is deprecated and I will not be providing any bug fixes related to\nRuby 1.8.

Further, apart from the standard scaffold views, it also creates an AJAX driven integrated view for your scaffold. It dries up your controllers and makes your models friendlier by adding schema stubs and standard validation options. Expect Cucumber integration in our next version"

The transaction methods added by this module will work with most\nobjects, excluding those that cannot be Marshal-ed (bindings, procedure\nobjects, IO instances, or singleton objects).\n\nThe transactions supported by Transaction::Simple are not associated with any\nsort of data store. They are \"live\" transactions occurring in memory on the\nobject itself. This is to allow \"test\" changes to be made to an object before\nmaking the changes permanent.\n\nTransaction::Simple can handle an \"infinite\" number of transaction levels\n(limited only by memory). If I open two transactions, commit the second, but\nabort the first, the object will revert to the original version.\n\nTransaction::Simple supports \"named\" transactions, so that multiple levels of\ntransactions can be committed, aborted, or rewound by referring to the\nappropriate name of the transaction. Names may be any object except nil.\n\nTransaction groups are also supported. A transaction group is an object wrapper\nthat manages a group of objects as if they were a single object for the purpose\nof transaction management. All transactions for this group of objects should be\nperformed against the transaction group object, not against individual objects\nin the group.\n\nVersion 1.4.0 of Transaction::Simple adds a new post-rewind hook so that\ncomplex graph objects of the type in tests/tc_broken_graph.rb can correct\nthemselves.\n\nVersion 1.4.0.1 just fixes a simple bug with #transaction method handling\nduring the deprecation warning.\n\nVersion 1.4.0.2 is a small update for people who use Transaction::Simple in\nbundler (adding lib/transaction-simple.rb) and other scenarios where having Hoe\nas a runtime dependency (a bug fixed in Hoe several years ago, but not visible\nin Transaction::Simple because it has not needed a re-release). All of the\nfiles internally have also been marked as UTF-8, ensuring full Ruby 1.9\ncompatibility."

It allows you to take any number of RSS feeds and post them to one or more Twitter accounts. An example of this is how various RSS feeds from the New York Times are sent to twitter accounts nytimes, nyt_arts, nyt_biz, etc. This is accomplished via a command-line script that requires a separate configuration file (see below). Since Twitter is a rapidly growing (read somewhat flaky) service, twitterize also uses a database to store twitters to be posted and recover later if twitter is down. This also allows the app to retain feed GUIDs and avoid duplicate posts."
