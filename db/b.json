In fact, let's put *every method* on one Base class!\n\nSo I did. It's called Base. Just subclass it and feel free to directly reference any class method, instance method, or constant defined on any module or class in the system. Like this:\n\n    class Cantaloupe < Base\n      def embiggen\n        encode64(deflate(SEPARATOR))\n      end\n    end\n\n    >> Cantaloupe.new.embiggen\n    => \"eJzTBwAAMAAw\\n\"\n\nSee that `embiggen` method calling `encode64` and `deflate` methods? Those come from the `Base64` and `Zlib` modules. And the `SEPARATOR` constant is defined in `File`. Base don't care where it's defined! Base calls what it wants!\n\nBy the way, remember those 530 ActiveRecord methods? That's amateur stuff. Check out Base loaded inside a Rails app:\n\n    >> Base.new.methods.count\n    => 6947\n\nIt's so badass that it takes *five seconds* just to answer that question! \n\nBase is just craaazzy!

Just write 2050 in that cell and recompile.\n\nSome tests fail for columns AN and AM on OUTPUT. I think this is due to rounding differences between excel and C.\n\n## DEPENDENCIES\n\n1. ruby 1.9.2 (including development headers)\n2. basic c development headers\n\nThis has ONLY been tested on OSX and on Ubuntu 64 bit EC2 ami.\nGrateful for reports from other platforms. \n\nIn the util folder there is an example script that creates a new EC2 EMI, installs all the dependencies and then compiles the gem. It may be useful if you are trying to figure out the complete set of dependencies.\n\n## INSTALLATION\n\nNote that this compiles the underlying c code, which might take 10-20 minutes or so\n\n    gem install belgium_2050_model\n  \n## UPDATING TO NEWER VERSIONS OF EXCEL MODEL\n\nFirst of all, you need to be working on the github version of the code, not the rubygem:\n    \n    git clone http://github.com/decc/belgium_2050_model\n\nThen put the new spreadsheet in spreadsheet/2050Model.xlsx\n\nThen, from the top directory of the gem:\n  \n    bundle\n    bundle exec rake\n  \nThe next step is to check whether lib/belgium_2050_model/belgium_2050_model_result.rb and lib/belgium_2050_model/model_structure.rb need to be altered so that they\npick up the correct places in the underlying excel.\n  \nThe final stage is to build and install the new gem:\n    \n    gem build belgium_2050_model.gemspec\n    gem install belgium_2050_model-<version>.gem \n\n... where <version> is the version number of the gem file that was created in the folder.\n  \nNow follow the instructions in the twenty-fifty server directory in order to ensure that it is using this new version of the gem.\n"

The idea is to use \nthis to verify the input in date input fields using AJAX, to \nprovide immediate feedback to the user.\n\n\n== Usage\n\nInclude Livedate in your middleware stack. In Rails, this\nis done in environment.rb\n\n  config.gem 'livedate'\n  config.middleware.use \"Livedate\"\n\nSpecify the desired date + datetime formats you want too. Default\nerror message for strings that Chronic can't pass can also \nbe provided. The defaults are:\n\n  config.middleware.use \"Livedate\", \n    :date_format => '%Y-%m-%d',\n    :datetime_format => ''%Y-%m-%d %H:%M',\n    :invalid_format => ''\n\nThis will catch requests to /parsedate. Use GET requests and\nprovide a parameter 'date' or 'datetime'. The value will be \nparsed by Chronic and returned formatted as 2009-01-01 or\n2009-01-01 12:45, depending on the parameter name.\n\n\n== Scripts\n\nThere are two generators available to get simple javascripts \nthat use livedate. Both will replace the contents on input\nelements with classes .date or .datetime on change with the\nresult from the Chronic parse.\n\n  script/generate livedate_jquery\n  script/generate livedate_prototype\n\nWill put the appropriate version of the script in your\npublic/javascripts directory. Feel free to change these\nif you need a different behavior.\n"

By including BlockChainable into your classes, you will be able to instantiate that class using the class name itself, followed by any parameters to be passed to initialize, followed by a block to be executed within the instantiated class.  BlockChainable also allows methods to search up the chain of classes, meaning that although a block is executed in the scope of the instantiated class, any methods not found in the class but found in a class &quot;up-scope&quot; will be called successfully on the up-scope class. This chaining of method calls allows you to assert values within the blocks as well as calling any other methods from &quot;up-scope&quot; classes.  == FEATURES/PROBLEMS:"

I rewrote it using the extension for speed and\naccuracy; the original BlueCloth was a straight port from the Perl version\nthat I wrote in a few days for my own use just to avoid having to shell out to\nMarkdown.pl, and it was quite buggy and slow. I apologize to all the good\npeople that sent me patches for it that were never released.\n\nNote that the new gem is called 'bluecloth' and the old one 'BlueCloth'.

With this configuration system, users can customize their autocompletions and share it with others. Bond can also load completions that ship with gems.

I make no promises about the quality,\nreliability, or performance of the code. I am writing this simply\nbecause it looked like a fun thing to write, and I wanted to.\n\n## WARNINGS ##\n\nThis is very much alpha code. As yet several important things are\nmissing including:\n\n* Any documentation\n* A test suite\n* Some sort of garbage collection routine within the lazy heap\n\nI cannot stress the last one enough as a reason to under no\ncircumstances use this library for any production work. Anything\nyou put in the lazy heap will live forever while the heap is still alive\n- as the heap keeps references to it the Ruby garbage collector will\nnever collect it.

    "description": "This is an experimental branch that implements a connection pool of \nNet::HTTP objects instead of a connection/thread.  C/T is fine if\nyou're only using your http threads to make connections but if you \nuse them in child threads then I suspect you will have a thread memory\nleak.  Also, I want to see if I get less connection resets if the\nmost recently used connection is always returned.\n\nAlso added a :force_retry option that if set to true will retry POST\nrequests as well as idempotent requests.\n\nThis branch is currently incompatible with the master branch in the \nfollowing ways:\n\n* It doesn't allow you to recreate the Net::HTTP::Persistent object\n  on the fly.  This is possible in the master version since all the \n  data is kept in thread local storage.  For this version, you should\n  probably create a class instance of the object and use that in your\n  instance methods.\n\n* It uses a hash in the initialize method.  This was easier for me\n  as I use a HashWithIndifferentAccess created from a YAML file to \n  define my options.  This should probably be modified to check the\n  arguments to achieve backwards compatibility.\n\n* The method shutdown is unimplemented as I wasn't sure how I should\n  implement it and I don't need it as I do a graceful shutdown from \n  nginx to finish up my connections.\n\nFor connection issues, I completely recreate a new Net::HTTP instance.\nI was running into an issue which I suspect is a JRuby bug where an\nSSL connection that times out would leave the ssl context in a frozen\nstate which would then make that connection unusable so each time that\nthread handled a connection a 500 error with the exception \"TypeError:\ncan't modify frozen\".  I think Joseph West's fork resolves this issue\nbut I'm paranoid so I recreate the object.\n\nCompatibility with the master version could probably be achieved by\ncreating a Strategy wrapper class for GenePool and a separate strategy\nclass with the connection/thread implementation."

This also means that you can publish the results of a Cucumber run to another system.\n\nBumps has been designed to work with {Bumpybot}[http://github.com/brentsnook/bumpybot] (a Google Wave robot) but it can be used with any server that meets the {push/pull contract}[http://wiki.github.com/brentsnook/bumps/push-pull-contract].\n\nSee the {wiki}[http://wiki.github.com/brentsnook/bumps] for more details."

Bus Scheme is primarily a toy; using it for anything serious is (right now) ill-advised.  Bus Scheme aims for general Scheme usefulness optimized for learning and fun. It's loosely targeting R5RS, but varies in huge ways. (For the purposes of this project we pretend that R6RS never happened.)

Further, placeholders are generated so you can\n  see your application working right away.\n\n  The best part is that you can pick and choose the bits of buzzard you\n  want to use.
